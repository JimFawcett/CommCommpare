# CommCompare

https://JimFawcett.io/CommCompare.html

Compare synchronous message-passing communication systems written in Rust and C++.  
- These projects use synchronous bilateral socket communication between connectors and listeners, sending variable size messages to and from both endpoints.
- The designs using Rust and C++ are as similar as practical and tested in the same way.
- Performances of the two are very close on Windows and Linux, using native hosting and virtual machines.
